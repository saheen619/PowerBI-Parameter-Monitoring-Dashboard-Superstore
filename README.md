# Parameter or Continuous Monitoring Dashboard Superstore

### Objective

The purpose is to create a dashboard which could be used for the continuous monitoring the parameters and trends and KPIs of a company. Here I have taken a sample Superstore data for the very own purpose. But you could relate the purpose with many relavant applications. To take the example of a company which rents out construction machines fixed with IOT Devices which transmits real time status of the machines, whcih should be monitored continuously for the purpose of safety, security and proper functioning. This is just a mock up a small use case of continuous monitoring, where i use sample superstores data.

The objective is to monitor Profitability & Discount variations and also to look at the Shipping Variations, which could potentially affect the revenue of the company on the long run and might lead to negative customer ratings. Thus by implementing a monitoring dasboard, for parameter monitoring, the company could make sure the operations are run effeciently.
